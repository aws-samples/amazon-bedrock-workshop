    "## Introduction to Inpainting\n",
    "\n",
    "With inpainting, you provide an image to be edited as well as a \"mask\" which defines which part of the image should be changed. The mask may either be provided as a black and white image (`maskImage`) or as a natural language description of what to change (`maskPrompt`). Inpainting can be used to remove items, replace items, or add new items to the original image.\n",

    "OctankFashion has decided to refresh their product line for the summer by creating beach themed shirts for men. They want to use the current white collared shirt with a dog on it as a starting point and just replace the dog with a palm tree.\n",

By utilizing either mask images or mask prompts, individuals can seamlessly remove unwanted objects, fill in missing areas, or even add new elements to existing images. This versatile tool has numerous applications, from photo restoration and digital art creation to removing distractions in professional photography. Whether you're touching up old family photos, creating imaginative digital compositions, or enhancing product images for e-commerce, inpainting offers a user-friendly solution for achieving polished, professional-looking results.\n"

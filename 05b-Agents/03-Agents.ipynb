We then deploy the Agent to [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html), which provides a secure, serverless and purpose-built hosting environment for deploying and running AI agents or tools, completly model and framework agnostic.

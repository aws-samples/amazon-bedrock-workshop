# Lab 0 - Introduction to Bedrock

This lab will walk you through the basics of connecting to the Amazon Bedrock service from Python with boto3.

First, ensure you've completed the setup in the ['Getting Started' section of the root README](../README.md#Getting-started)

Then, you'll be ready to walk through the notebook [bedrock_basics.ipynb](bedrock_basics.ipynb), which shows how to install the required packages, connect to Bedrock, and invoke models. Before running any of the labs ensure you've run the [Bedrock boto3 setup notebook](../00_Prerequisites/bedrock_basics.ipynb).

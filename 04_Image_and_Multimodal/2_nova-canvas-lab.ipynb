    "# Module 4 - Exploring Image Generation with **Amazon Nova Canvas**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on session, we'll explore the powerful capabilities of Amazon Nova Canvas to create compelling visual ads for Octank, a premium dog food company.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll explore Amazon Nova Canvas, a state-of-the-art image generation model that creates high-quality, photorealistic visuals from text prompts. Nova Canvas supports advanced features such as text-to-image generation, inpainting, outpainting, image variation, and subject consistency. These capabilities make it a powerful tool for applications like product visualization, creative design, and content generation—enabling businesses to produce studio-quality images at scale, accelerate content workflows, and enhance customer experiences with highly tailored visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Octank is launching a new dog food line and wants to create various visual assets:\n",
    "- Generate an initial product package design\n",
    "- Create variations of the package design, including a oil-painting style version\n",
    "- Design a special promotional package using specific brand colors\n",
    "- Produce a professional-looking ad with the product in a kitchen setting\n",
    "- Isolate the product image for use in various marketing materials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook lab, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the key features of Amazon Nova Canvas\n",
    "- Learn how to use these features for a real-world marketing scenario\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience with the Amazon Bedrock API for image generation tasks\n",

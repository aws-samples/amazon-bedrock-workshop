    "### Image prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a good prompt can be somewhat of an art. It's often difficult to predict whether a certain prompt will yield a satisfactory image with a given model. However, there are certain templates that have been observed to work. Broadly, a prompt can be roughly broken down into three pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type** of image (photograph/sketch/painting etc.)\n",
    "2. **Description** of the content (subject/object/environment/scene etc.), and\n",
    "3. **Style** of the image (realistic/artistic/type of art etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change each of the three parts individually to generate variations of an image. Adjectives have been known to play a significant role in the image generation process. Also, adding more details help in the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a realistic image, you can use phrases such as “a photo of”, “a photograph of”, “realistic” or “hyper realistic”. To generate images by artists you can use phrases like “by Pablo Piccaso” or “oil painting by Rembrandt” or “landscape art by Frederic Edwin Church” or “pencil drawing by Albrecht Dürer”. You can also combine different artists as well. To generate artistic image by category, you can add the art category in the prompt such as “lion on a beach, abstract”. Some other categories include “oil painting”, “pencil drawing, “pop art”, “digital art”, “anime”, “cartoon”, “futurism”, “watercolor”, “manga” etc. You can also include details such as lighting or camera lens such as 35mm wide lens or 85mm wide lens and details about the framing (portrait/landscape/close up etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that model generates different images even if same prompt is given multiple times. So, you can generate multiple images and select the image that suits your application best."

As shown below, the `width` of the image was set to 768px and the `height` remains at its default value of 512px. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to nudge the model to ***avoid*** specific content or style choices? Because image generation models are typically trained from *image descriptions*, trying to directly specify what you **don't** want in the prompt (for example `man without a beard`) doesn't usually work well: It would be very unusual to describe an image by the things it isn't!\n",

    "\n",
    "One key point to note when using Bedrock is that output image PNG/JPEG data is returned as a [Base64 encoded string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) within the JSON API response: You can use the Python built-in [base64 library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) to decode this image data - for example to save a `.png` file. We also showed that image processing libraries like [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be used to load (and perhaps edit) the images within Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "As seen in previous tutorials, LLM conversational interfaces such as chatbots or virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience of customers. These can be improved even more by giving them context from related sources such as chat history, documents, websites, social media platforms, and / or messaging apps, this is called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and is a fundamental backbone of designing robust AI solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One persistent bottleneck however is the inability of LLMs to assess whether data extracted and or its response, based on said data, is accurate and fully encapsulates a user requests (hallucinating). A way to mitigate this risk brought up by naive, inferencing with RAG is through the use of Agents. Agents are defined as a workflow that uses data, tools, and its own inferences to check that the response provided is accurate and meets users goals.\n",

    "\n",
    "The core benefit of agentic workflows lies in its flexibility to adjust to your needs. You have full control on the design the flow by properly defining what the agents do and what tools and information is available to them. One popular framework for the use of Agents is called Langgraph, a low-level framework that offers the ability of adding cycles (using previous inferences as context to either fix or build on it), controllability of the flow and state of your application, and persistence, giving the agents the ability to involve humans in the loop and the memory to recall past agentic flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For this scenario we'll define 3 agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We defined a supervisor agent responsible for deciding the steps needed to fulfill the users request, this can take the shape of using tools or data retrieval. \n",
    "2. Then a task-driven agent to retrieve documents which can be invoked only when the orchestrator agent deems it necessary to fulfill the users request. \n",
    "3. Finally, a data retriever agent will query an embedding database containing Medical history if its deemed necessary to use this information to answer the users question.\n"

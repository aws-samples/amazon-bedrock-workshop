    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock - Retrieve API. Here, we will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search. We will then augment the prompt with relevant documents and query which will go as input to Anthropic Claude V2 for generating response.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a knowledge base, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "We will cover 2 parts in the notebook:\n",
    "- Part 1, we will share how you can use `RetrieveAPI` with foundation models from Amazon Bedrock. We will use the `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` model. \n",
    "- Part 2, we will showcase the langchain integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on the knowledge base created using console/sdk. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and ingested in vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). \n",
    "2.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the text chunks being generated and augment it with the original prompt and pass it through the `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` model using prompt engineering patterns based on your use case.\n",

    "\n",
    "### USE CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. You will need the `knowledge base id` to run this example.\n",
    "In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",

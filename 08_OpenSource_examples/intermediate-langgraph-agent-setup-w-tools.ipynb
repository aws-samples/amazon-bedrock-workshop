    "# Lab 3: Building a Travel Planner with a Simple LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab guides you through the process of creating a simple Travel Planner using LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-step applications with language models. The Travel Planner demonstrates how to structure a conversational AI application that collects user input and generates personalized travel itineraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to Agents\n",
    "- Agents are leverage LLM to `think step by step` and then plan the execution\n",
    "- Agents have access to tools\n",
    "- Agents have access to memory. Below diagram illustrates this concept\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Management\n",
    "Memory is key for any agentic conversation which is `Multi-Turn` or `Multi-Agent` colloboration conversation and more so if it spans multiple days. The 3 main aspects of Agents are:\n",
    "1. Tools\n",
    "2. Memory\n",
    "3. Planners\n",
    "\n",
    "- ![Agent memory](./assets/agents_memory_light.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Travel Planner follows a straightforward, three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial User Input**: \n",
    "   - The application prompts the user to enter their desired travel plan to get assistance from AI Agent.\n",
    "   - This information is stored in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interests Input**:\n",
    "   - The user is asked to provide their interests for the trip.\n",
    "   - These interests are stored as a list in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Itinerary Creation**:\n",
    "   - Using the collected city and interests, the application leverages a language model to generate a personalized day trip itinerary.\n",
    "   - The generated itinerary is presented to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow between these steps is managed by LangGraph, which handles the state transitions and ensures that each step is executed in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below diagram illustrates this:\n",

    "## LangGraph -- State Graph, Nodes and Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are initializing the ```StateGraph```. This object will encapsulate the graph being traversed during excecution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define the **nodes** in our graph. In LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions. There are two main nodes we will use for our graph:\n",
    "- The agent node: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.\n",
    "- The tool node: This node will orchestrate calling the respective tool and returning the output. This means if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges** define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\n",
    "- Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\n",
    "- Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\n",
    "- Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we need to define a conditional edge that routes to the ```ToolNode``` when a tool get called in the agent node, i.e. when the LLM determines the requirement of tool use. With ```tools_condition```, LangGraph provides a preimplemented function handling this. Further, an edge from the ```START```node to the ```assistant```and from the ```ToolNode``` back to the ```assistant``` are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are adding the nodes, edges as well as a persistant memory to the ```StateGraph``` before we compile it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Agent State\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define the state that our agent will maintain throughout its operation. First, define the [State](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state) of the graph.  The State schema serves as the input schema for all Nodes and Edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the `TypedDict` class from python's `typing` module as our schema, which provides type hints for the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **StateGraph**: The core of our application, defining the flow of our Travel Planner.\n",
    "2. **PlannerState**: A custom type representing the state of our planning process.\n",
    "3. **Node Functions**: Individual steps in our planning process (input_city, input_interests, create_itinerary).\n",
    "4. **LLM Integration**: Utilizing a language model to generate the final itinerary.\n",
    "5. **Memory Integration**: Utilizing long term and short term memory for conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll define the main functions nodes that our agent will use: get interests, create itinerary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Nodes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#nodes) are python functions.\n",
    "- The first positional argument is the state, as defined above. \n",
    "- State is a `TypedDict` with schema as defined above, each node can access the key, `graph_state`, with `state['graph_state']`. \n",
    "- Each node returns a new value of the state key `graph_state`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "By default, the new value returned by each node [will override](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#reducers) the prior state value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will disscuss memory is detail in subsequent sections below how some some key points\n",
    "2. We have `Conversational Memory` which is needed for all agents to have context since this is a `ChatBot` which needs history of conversations\n",
    "3. We usually summarize these into a **Summary Conversation** alternating with Human | AI for multi session conversations\n",
    "4. We have the concept of Graph State which is for Async workflows where we need to resume the workflow from a **certain point** in history\n",
    "\n",
    "For `A-Sync` workflows where we need to persist the state of the graph and bring it back once we get the required data. below diagram explains this concept. \n",

    "You have successfully executed a simple LangGraph implementation, this lab demonstrates how LangGraph can be used to create a simple yet effective Travel Planner. By structuring our application as a graph of interconnected nodes, we achieve a clear separation of concerns and a easily modifiable workflow. This approach can be extended to more complex applications, showcasing the power and flexibility of graph-based designs in AI-driven conversational interfaces.\n",

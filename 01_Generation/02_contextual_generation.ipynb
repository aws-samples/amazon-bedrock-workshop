    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show you how to generate an email response to a customer who was not happy with the quality of customer service that they received from the customer support engineer. We will provide additional context to the model by providing the contents of the actual email that was received from the unhappy customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of additional context in the prompt, the text produced by the Amazon Titan Large language model in this notebook is of much better quality and relevance than the content produced earlier through zero-shot prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The key aspects of this framework allow us to augment the Large Language Models by chaining together various components to create advanced use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the Bedrock API provided by LangChain. The prompt used in this example creates a custom LangChain prompt template for adding context to the text generation request. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *This notebook can be run within or outside of AWS environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "In the previous example `01_zero_shot_generation.ipynb`, we explored how to use LangChain framework to communicate with Amazon Bedrock API. In this notebook we will try to add a bit more complexity with the help of `PromptTemplates` to leverage the LangChain framework for the similar use case. `PrompTemplates` allow you to create generic shells which can be populated with information later and get model outputs based on different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this notebook we will explore the use of Amazon Bedrock integration within LangChain framework and how it could be used to generate text with the help of `PromptTemplate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern\n",
    "We will simply provide the LangChain implementation of Amazon Bedrock API with an input consisting of a task, an instruction and an input for the model under the hood to generate an output without providing any additional example. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the powerful LLMs easily understand the task at hand and generate compelling outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/bedrock_langchain.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "To demonstrate the generation capability of models in Amazon Bedrock, let's take the use case of email generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "You are Bob a Customer Service Manager at AnyCompany and some of your customers are not happy with the customer service and are providing negative feedbacks on the service provided by customer support engineers. Now, you would like to respond to those customers humbly aplogizing for the poor service and regain trust. You need the help of an LLM to generate a bulk of emails for you which are human friendly and personalized to the customer's sentiment from previous email correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "To fulfill this use case, we will show you how to generate an email with a thank you note based on the customer's previous email. We will use the Amazon Titan Text Large model using the Amazon Bedrock LangChain integration. \n"

    "\n",
    "Before running the rest of this notebook, you'll need to run the cells below to (ensure necessary libraries are installed and) connect to Bedrock.\n",

    "For more details on how the setup works and ⚠️ **whether you might need to make any changes**, refer to the [Bedrock boto3 setup notebook](../00_Intro/bedrock_boto3_setup.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how to use a LLM to generate an email response to a customer who provided negative feedback on the quality of customer service that they received from the support engineer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Anthropic's Claude model provided by Bedrock in this example. We will use the Bedrock version that is integrated with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html). LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The key aspects of this framework allow us to augment the Large Language Models by chaining together various components to create advanced use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the Bedrock API provided by LangChain. The prompt used in this example is called a zero-shot prompt because we are not providing any additional context other than the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *This notebook can be run within or outside of AWS environment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "In this notebook, we will leverage the LangChain framework and explore how to use Boto3 client to communicate with Amazon Bedrock API. We will explore the use of Amazon Bedrock integration within LangChain framework and how it could be used to generate text with the help of `PromptTemplate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern\n",
    "We will simply provide the LangChain implementation of Amazon Bedrock API with an input consisting of a task, an instruction and an input for the model under the hood to generate an output without providing any additional example. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the powerful LLMs easily understand the task at hand and generate compelling outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/bedrock_langchain.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Case\n",
    "To demonstrate the generation capability of models in Amazon Bedrock, let's take the use case of email generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "You are Bob a Customer Service Manager at AnyCompany and some of your customers are not happy with the customer service and are providing negative feedbacks on the service provided by customer support engineers. Now, you would like to respond to those customers humbly aplogizing for the poor service and regain trust. You need the help of an LLM to generate a bulk of emails for you which are human friendly and personalized to the customer's sentiment from previous email correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "To fulfill this use case, in this notebook we will show how to generate an email with a thank you note based on the customer's previous email. We will use the Amazon Titan Text Large model using the Amazon Bedrock LangChain integration. "

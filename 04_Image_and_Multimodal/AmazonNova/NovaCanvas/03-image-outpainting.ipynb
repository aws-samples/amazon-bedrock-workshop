    "## Introduction to Outpainting\n",
    "\n",
    "With outpainting, you provide an image to be edited as well as a \"mask\" which defines which part of the image should be preserved. The mask may either be provided as a black and white image (`maskImage`) or as a natural language description of what parts of the image to retain (`maskPrompt`). Outpainting can be used to replace the background of an image, placing the image's subject in a whole new environment or special background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, OctankFashion wants to create a professional-looking ad image featuring this new product in a realistic setting. This is often referred to as \"lifestyle\" imagery. The theme of the lifestyle image will be \"fun at the beach\". The atmosphere we want to evoke is that of a sunny day at the beach.\n"

    "- `image` (Required) – The JPEG or PNG image to modify, encoded as a Base64 string. (See code below for how to encode an image as Base64.)\n",
    "- You must define one of the following fields (but not both) in order to specify the area of the image to affect:\n",
    "  - `maskPrompt` – A natural language text prompt that describes the region(s) of the image to edit.\n",
    "  - `maskImage` – A black and white image in which pure black pixels indicate the area inside the mask and pure white pixels indicate the area outside the mask. The mask image must be the same dimensions at the input image. Its dimensions must match the dimensions of the input `image`.\n",
    "- `outPaintingMode` – There are two outpainting modes which determine how the mask you provide is interpreted.\n",
    "  - “DEFAULT” – This mode transitions smoothly between the masked area and non-masked area, using some of the pixels of the original background as the starting point for the new background. This mode is often best when you would like the new background to use similar colors as the original background near the edges of your mask, but can result in a halo effect if your prompt calls for a new background that will be very different from the original background.\n",
    "  - “PRECISE” – This mode adheres strictly to the mask’s bounds and is often the best option when you are making more significant changes to the background of your image.\n",

    "Outpainting is a versatile image manipulation technique that extends the capabilities of traditional editing tools. This feature allows users to replace backgrounds or seamlessly expand the boundaries of existing images with remarkable ease. By intelligently generating content beyond the original image borders, outpainting enables creators to extend scenes, add new elements, or completely transform the context of an image. Whether you're looking to widen a landscape photo, adapt an image to different aspect ratios, or replace a mundane background with something more exciting, outpainting offers a powerful solution.\n"

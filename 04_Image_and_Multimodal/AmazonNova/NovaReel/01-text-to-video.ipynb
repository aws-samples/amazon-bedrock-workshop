    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Amazon Nova Reel Workshop! In this hands-on session, we'll explore the powerful capabilities of Amazon's video generation foundation model. You'll experience how **OctankFashion**, a fictional clothing brand, uses the model to create videos for use in their marketing and advertising campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "OctankFashion would like to incorporate more rich video content into their marketing and advertising. They find traditional video production to be both too time-consuming and cost prohibitive, having to rent equipment, hire a video production agency, and pay for travel to on-location shoots. They will apply Nova Reel to tasks including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating an evocative lifestyle video of their new line of summer t-shirts.\n",
    "2. Turning one of their existing marketing images into full motion video.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the key features of Amazon Nova Reel model.\n",
    "2. Learn how to use these features for marketing and advertising use cases.\n",
    "3. Gain hands-on experience with the Amazon Bedrock API for video generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features We'll Use\n",
    "\n",
    "During the workshop, we'll leverage the following features of Amazon Nova Reel:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text-to-Video\n",
    "2. Image-to-Video\n",

    "## Building Q&A application using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock - RetrieveAndGenerate API\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "With knowledge bases, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application using `RetrieveAndGenerate` API provided by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. This API will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search, integrate it with Large Language Model (LLM) for answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on the knowledge base created in the previous notebook or using console. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and stored in knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). \n",
    "2. Ingestion - Knowledge base will split them into smaller chunks (based on the strategy selected), generate embeddings and store it in the associated vectore store and notebook [0_create_ingest_documents_test_kb.ipynb](./0\\_create_ingest_documents_test_kb.ipynb) takes care of it for you.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For our notebook we will use the `RetreiveAndGenerate API` provided by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock which converts user queries into\n",
    "embeddings, searches the knowledge base, get the relevant results, augment the prompt and then invoking a LLM to generate the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following workflow for this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "![retrieveAndGenerate.png](./images/retrieveAndGenerate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### USE CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the knowledge base. You will need the `knowledge base id` and `model ARN` to run this example. We are using `Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku` model for generating responses to user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠  For this lab we need to run the notebook based on a Python 3.10 runtime. ⚠\n",

    "### Setup\n",

    "Install following packages. "

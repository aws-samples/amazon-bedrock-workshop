    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Amazon Nova Canvas Workshop! In this hands-on session, we'll explore the powerful capabilities of Amazon's latest image generation foundation model. You'll experience how **OctankFashion**, a fictional clothing brand, applies the model's rich set of features to a range of tasks – from clothing design to marketing and advertising to retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "OctankFashion would like to leverage AI image generation to streamline both their clothing design process and the production of marketing and advertising imagery. Specific tasks will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use AI to iterate on new t-shirt designs.\n",
    "2. After designing a t-shirt, use AI to create a new summer-themed variation of that shirt.\n",
    "3. Create a special promotional photo featuring the shirt in a lifestyle setting.\n",
    "4. Take existing successful clothing ads and remove the background so the clothing component can be used as the product image on their retail website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the key features of Amazon Nova Canvas model.\n",
    "2. Learn how to use these features for design, marketing, and retail use cases.\n",
    "3. Gain hands-on experience with the Amazon Bedrock API for image generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features We'll Use\n",
    "\n",
    "During the workshop, we'll leverage the following features of Amazon Nova Canvas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text-to-Image\n",
    "2. Inpainting\n",
    "3. Outpainting\n",
    "4. Background Removal\n",
    "5. Image Variation\n",
    "6. Image Conditioning\n",
    "7. Color Conditioning\n"

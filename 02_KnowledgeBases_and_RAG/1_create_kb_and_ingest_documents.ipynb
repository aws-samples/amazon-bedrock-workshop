    "\n",
    "Foundation models (FMs) are powerful generative AI models trained on vast amounts of general-purpose data. However, many real-world applications require these models to generate responses grounded in domain-specific or proprietary information. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative AI responses by retrieving relevant information from external data sources at query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bedrock Knowledge Bases (BKBs) provide a fully managed capability to implement RAG-based solutions. By integrating your own data — such as documents, manuals, or knowledge articles — into a knowledge base, you can improve the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of model-generated responses. When a user submits a query, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases search across the ingested data, retrieve the most relevant content, and pass this information to the foundation model to generate a more informed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create an empty Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) index, build an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, and ingest documents into it for retrieval-augmented generation."

    "In this notebook, we walked through the process of creating an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (BKB) and ingesting documents to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. We started by setting up the environment, installing the required libraries, and initializing the necessary AWS service clients. Then, we created an Amazon S3 bucket to store unstructured data (PDF documents) and uploaded sample files. We proceeded by provisioning an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) collection and index, configuring the appropriate IAM roles and permissions, and granting access to the BKB. Finally, we created the BKB, connected it to the S3 data source, and synchronized the documents to generate vector embeddings, which were stored in AOSS.\n",

These use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries and can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. usuallythey are augmented by fetching information from various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps which involve a complex workflow as shown below\n",

Highs are typically in the 50s and 60s°F.\\n\\n- Seattle gets an average of 37 inches of rainfall per year, with the wettest months being November through January.\\n\\n- While Seattle has a reputation for being rainy, it actually gets less annual rainfall than many East Coast cities. However, the rain tends to linger with many overcast/drizzly days.\\n\\n- Snow is relatively rare, with just a few inches falling during winter in a typical year.\\n\\nSo in summary, expect cool, wet winters and mild, drier summers in Seattle's temperate maritime climate.

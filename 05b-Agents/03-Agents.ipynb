Customers can bring OpenAPI spec or Smithy models for their existing APIs, or add Lambda functions that front their tools. Gateway will provide a uniform Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface across all these tools. Gateway employs a dual authentication model to ensure secure access control for both incoming requests and outbound connections to target resources. The framework consists of two key components: Inbound Auth, which validates and authorizes users attempting to access gateway targets, and Outbound Auth, which enables the gateway to securely connect to backend resources on behalf of authenticated users. Together, these authentication mechanisms create a secure bridge between users and their target resources, supporting both IAM credentials and OAuth-based authentication flows. Gateway supports MCP's Streamable HTTP transport connection.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Strands agent seamlessly integrates with AWS tools through the Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, which implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification. This integration enables secure, standardized communication between AI agents and AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the Bedrock AgentCore Gateway serves as a protocol-compliant Gateway that exposes fundamental MCP APIs: ListTools and InvokeTools. These APIs allow any MCP-compliant client or SDK to discover and interact with available tools in a secure, standardized way. When the Strands agent needs to access AWS services, it communicates with the Gateway using these MCP-standardized endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gateway's implementation adheres strictly to the (MCP Authorization specification)[https://modelcontextprotocol.org/specification/draft/basic/authorization], ensuring robust security and access control. This means that every tool invocation by the Strands agent goes through authorization step, maintaining security while enabling powerful functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when the Strands agent needs to access MCP tools, it first calls ListTools to discover available tools, then uses InvokeTools to execute specific actions. The Gateway handles all the necessary security validations, protocol translations, and service interactions, making the entire process seamless and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architectural approach means that any client or SDK that implements the MCP specification can interact with AWS services through the Gateway, making it a versatile and future-proof solution for AI agent integrations."
